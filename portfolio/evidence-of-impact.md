## Evidence of Impact

### Key Data
- **AP CS Principles Impact:** Taught to an entire 10th-grade cohort (~120 students per year, 2017–2019). Each year improved number of students completing all sections and receiving scores.
- **9th Grade Computing:** Delivered introductory computing courses to approximately 120 students per year (2012–2016) from a broad, unscreened population.
- **Data Science Engagement:** Increased emphasis on project-based learning in later years, leading to measurable improvements in students' statistical and computational thinking.
- **Overall Reach:** Over 1,000 students have been exposed to innovative, hands-on CS curricula that bridge computer science with fundamental mathematical reasoning.

### Representative Student Work
- **Student Data Science Projects:** 
  A standout example where a student analyzed soda data using statistical methods and data visualization tools. This project not only showcased technical proficiency but also real-world problem-solving.
