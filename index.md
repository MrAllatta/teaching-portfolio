## Welcome!

I'm an experienced teacher-leader who has spent the past decade [designing, building, and refining]({{ '/timeline' | relative_url }}) hands-on, equitable computer science and math programs in NYC public schools.  
	Through [teaching]({{ '/student-work' | relative_url }}), [coaching and curriculum design]({{ '/teaching/professional-development' | relative_url }}), and [tools development]({{ '/tools' | relative_url }}), I have helped [entire departments]({{ '/impact/mastery' | relative_url}}) — and [whole schools]({{ '/case-studies/dashboards' | relative_url }}) — grow stronger, more coherent, and more supportive for students and staff alike.

## Areas of Focus

### Teaching & Learning
**[Authentic, Accessible Projects]({{ '/student-work' | relative_url }})**  
Rigorous and creative CS/math curricula — including [capstone projects]({{ '/student-work' | relative_url }}), [integrated algebra supports]({{ '/student-work/flag-project' | relative_url }}), and [real-world data science experiences]({{ '/student-work/data-science' | relative_url }}) — for students of all backgrounds.

### Systems & Tools
**[Infrastructure that Amplifies Good Work]({{ '/tools' | relative_url }})**  
Custom-built [grading platforms]({{ '/tools/grade-converter' | relative_url }}), [engagement dashboards]({{ '/tools/dashboard' | relative_url }}), [communication systems]({{ '/tools/ats-remind' | relative_url }}), and other ["invisible glue"]({{ '/case-studies/dashboards' | relative_url }}) that made mastery-based, student-centered practices actually sustainable.

### Team Development
**[Collaborative Growth]({{ '/case-studies/mastery-grading' | relative_url }})**  
Led multi-year department efforts to [align mastery standards]({{ '/case-studies/mastery-rubric' | relative_url }}), [co-design rubrics]({{ '/case-studies/mastery-rubric' | relative_url }}), and [build a culture of project-based learning]({{ '/case-studies/project-csp' | relative_url }}) — while [mentoring new teachers]({{ '/pd' | relative_url }}) and [supporting cross-team planning]({{ '/case-studies/engagement-survey' | relative_url }}).

## Featured Projects
- **[Mastery Rubrics Aligned Across CS + Math]({{ '/case-studies/mastery-rubric' | relative_url }})**  
  Facilitated design and implementation of shared mastery grading standards.
- **[Data Science Research Project]({{ '/projects/data-science-research-project' | relative_url }})**  
  Full-cohort data investigations with real-world datasets and public presentations.
- **[Schoolwide Dashboard Systems]({{ '/case-studies/dashboards' | relative_url }})**  
  Built custom spreadsheets that streamlined grading, attendance, interventions, and parent outreach — visible at the admin, team, and student levels.

## About Me
I believe that schools should be places where **students feel powerful**, **teachers feel supported**, and **systems work quietly in the background** — not against the people in them.
