## Case Study: From Data to Action — Student-Led Engagement Research

**Overview:**  
This project invited students to investigate their own school experience through the lens of data. The result was a fully student-designed engagement survey, honest insights from peers, and real conversations with staff about how the school could better meet student needs.

**Challenge:**  
How do you teach statistical thinking, inquiry, and data visualization in a way that feels real—not like a worksheet? And how do you let students critique school systems without it turning performative or punitive?

### What We Did
- Facilitated student teams to **design and deploy an engagement survey** for 9th and 10th grade cohorts
- Focused on **question design**, **bias reduction**, and **scaling choices** to teach fundamentals of data literacy
- Supported data cleaning in Sheets and exploratory analysis in Pyret and Docs
- Students presented findings to peers and teachers in class-wide reflection sessions

### What Worked
- Students were **deeply motivated** by the opportunity to study their own reality
- The project surfaced insights that hadn’t reached staff through traditional surveys
- Survey response quality showed **unfiltered honesty**, humor, and frustration—fuel for learning and change
- The authenticity of the dataset made students more invested in **visualization and interpretation** work

### What We Learned
- Framing matters—when students are treated as researchers, they rise to the role
- Open-ended feedback created risk, but also trust and truth
- Data projects don’t need fancy tools—they need context, structure, and a real audience

> _“We’re always being told what school should be. This time, we got to ask what it is—and how it could be different.”_ — Student reflection

This case shows how data science can empower students not just to *complete* analysis, but to *generate* it—and use it to reflect on the systems they move through every day.
