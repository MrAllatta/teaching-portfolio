Welcome to my teaching portfolio. I am a dedicated educator with a background in computer science, mathematics, and curriculum design, committed to fostering deep conceptual understanding through rigorous, student-centered instruction.

This portfolio showcases my teaching philosophy, lesson materials, student work, and professional achievements, highlighting my ability to design engaging, equity-focused learning experiences that prepare students for both academic success and real-world problem-solving.
