## Philosophy

**Introduction**  

Learning takes time. True understanding cannot be rushed, yet many students feel pressured to appear as if they are learning rather than engaging deeply with the material. In classrooms where constant scrutiny fosters a fear of failure, students often divert their energy into performative engagement—looking busy, memorizing surface-level facts, or giving the "right" answers—rather than taking the intellectual risks necessary for genuine growth.  

My approach to teaching acknowledges this reality and works against it. I emphasize **frequent, repeated, and rewarded encounters** with core concepts to build fluency, followed by **structured challenges** that push students toward mastery. This balance between **reinforcement and challenge** is at the heart of my curriculum design. In my experience, students thrive when they receive **clear, standards-based feedback** that helps them track their progress without fear of punitive grading. Whether in computer science or mathematics, I create learning environments where mistakes are seen as an essential part of the process—where fluency develops through practice, and mastery emerges from meaningful struggle.  

This portfolio showcases my commitment to **deep, lasting learning** through well-structured lessons, authentic assessments, and an instructional approach that prioritizes understanding over mere performance.

** Computer Science

**Teaching Philosophy: AP Computer Science Principles**

### A Data-First Approach to Computer Science

Computer science is fundamentally a discipline of problem-solving, abstraction, and the transformation of information into structured, computable data. My approach to teaching AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) prioritizes a **data-first pedagogy**, where students learn to recognize and categorize data in real-world problem contexts before translating them into computational representations. This approach ensures that students develop a **foundational understanding of computing as a means to process, analyze, and manipulate data to generate meaningful outcomes**.

### Equity and Accessibility in Computing Education

AP CSP was designed with a mission to **broaden participation in computing**, and my curriculum is structured to reflect that goal. By implementing a carefully scaffolded learning experience that is appropriate for a general 10th-grade population, I ensure that all students—regardless of prior experience—can succeed. The use of **functional programming** (Racket and Pyret) in early units enables students to leverage algebraic reasoning skills, thereby reinforcing mathematical concepts while developing computational fluency. **Structured problem-solving strategies, collaborative projects, and interdisciplinary connections** further support students in seeing computer science as an accessible and impactful field.

### Developing Computational Thinkers, Not Just Coders

Programming is only one facet of computational thinking. My curriculum explicitly teaches students to **abstract complex systems, analyze problems systematically, and create meaningful computational artifacts**. By integrating **the design recipe methodology**, students develop step-by-step strategies for writing functions, tracing evaluations, and debugging code. This structured approach provides them with concrete tools to tackle problems independently, **encouraging autonomy and persistence** in problem-solving.

### Assessment for Growth and Mastery

Assessment in my classroom is **iterative, standards-based, and designed for student growth**. Frequent, low-stakes formative assessments—such as peer feedback, self-reflection, and scaffolded exercises—allow students to engage in continuous improvement. Summative assessments, including **performance-based projects and structured code reviews**, evaluate not only correctness but also students’ ability to reason about and communicate their computational thinking. My grading structure reflects mastery learning principles: students have the opportunity to revise work, ensuring that **grades reflect skill acquisition rather than task completion**.

### Fostering Creativity and Real-World Connections

One of the most powerful aspects of computing is its ability to facilitate **creative expression and real-world problem-solving**. Throughout the course, students engage in projects that allow them to explore computing innovations, create original digital artifacts, and reflect on the societal impact of computing. The curriculum emphasizes **interdisciplinary connections, particularly with mathematics and English**, ensuring that students develop computational literacy alongside traditional academic skills. The **Explore Task and Create Task** of the AP CSP course serve as culminating experiences where students showcase their ability to research, analyze, and build computational solutions to real-world problems.

### Preparing Students for Future Learning

My course serves as the second step in a **three-year computing sequence**, positioning students to transition smoothly into AP Computer Science A and beyond. By emphasizing **functional programming, structured reasoning, and algorithmic problem-solving**, students build robust conceptual models that prepare them for imperative programming paradigms and advanced study in computer science. Additionally, the curriculum integrates **critical discussions on data privacy, security, and the ethical implications of computing**, ensuring that students are not only proficient programmers but also informed and responsible digital citizens.

### Conclusion

My teaching philosophy for AP CSP centers on **building confident, reflective, and adaptable problem solvers**. Through a structured, data-first approach, interdisciplinary collaboration, and an emphasis on mastery learning, I strive to **make computer science accessible, meaningful, and transformative for all students**. Whether they pursue careers in computing or apply their problem-solving skills in other domains, my students leave the course with a deep understanding of how computing shapes our world—and how they can shape computing in return.
