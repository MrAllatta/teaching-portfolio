# Revised CS Program Proposal – NYC Museum School

**Prepared by:** Eric Allatta
**Date:** May 9 2025

## Vision

The NYC Museum School has a unique opportunity to develop a CS program that reflects its commitment to interdisciplinary inquiry, civic engagement, and deep thinking. This proposal outlines a phased build of a 9–12 computer science pathway, beginning with a full-grade 9 introductory course and expanding to include advanced electives and AP Computer Science A.

This program treats computing not as an isolated technical skill, but as a language for modeling the world, engaging with complexity, and building tools with purpose.

## Guiding Principles

* **Computing is Interdisciplinary:** Leverage museum modules and project-based structures to integrate computing with humanities, social sciences, art, and math.
* **Structure Creates Access:** A consistent course sequence and pedagogical approach makes CS accessible to a wide range of learners.
* **Thinking Comes First:** Prioritize abstraction, algorithmic reasoning, and transferable problem-solving over rote coding.
* **Equity is Design, Not Just Intent:** Scaffold inclusive pathways into advanced coursework without tracking students out early.

## Year 1 (2024–2025): Launch Year

* **Full-cohort 9th Grade Intro to CS**

  * One semester course for all 9th graders
  * Focus: data, algorithms, abstraction, responsible computing
  * Tools: Pyret, Python, REPL-based environments
  * Projects connected to museum themes and real-world systems

* **Elective for Upper Grades:** "Code as Curation"

  * Data and culture through the lens of museum metadata (e.g., Met Open Access API)
  * Focus on systems thinking, representation, and digital storytelling

* **Proposal Development for AP CS A**

  * Build community of interest among 10th/11th graders
  * Begin curriculum planning and resource alignment

## Year 2 (2025–2026): Expansion Year

* **AP Computer Science A Launch**

  * Serve 11th/12th grade students with strong interest and readiness
  * Use Java and College Board framework, but tie back to real-world algorithmic analysis

* **Continue 9th Grade CS**

  * Refine intro course based on year one feedback
  * Scaffold supports for students who need enrichment or additional time

* **Introduce Data Science & Ethics Elective**

  * Topics: bias, privacy, visualization, civic tech
  * Tools: Python, Pandas, Plotly, public datasets

## Year 3 (2026–2027): Establish the Pathway

* **3-Year Course Sequence**

  1. Intro to CS (9th)
  2. Advanced Elective or Data Science (10th–11th)
  3. AP CS A (11th–12th)

* **Interdisciplinary Module Partnerships**

  * Collaborate with teachers in humanities, science, and art to embed CS into existing modules
  * Example: "Identities" + Data & Bias / "Activism" + Protest Mapping

* **Capstone & Public Showcase**

  * Students present culminating interdisciplinary computing projects
  * Tie to AP Capstone where relevant

## Staffing and Resources

* **Current Need (2024–25):** 1 FTE CS teacher (can cover 9th and advanced elective)
* **Future Growth:** Additional 0.5–1.0 FTE if AP and multiple electives are to run concurrently
* **Supports:** Laptops, REPL environments, partnerships (CS4All, Bootstrap, TEALS, etc.)

## Summary

This plan positions Museum School as a forward-looking, integrative CS program builder within NYC. By embedding computer science into the core intellectual work of the school, we make room for more students to access real, rigorous, joyful computing.
