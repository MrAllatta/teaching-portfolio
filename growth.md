## Timeline of Growth & Learning

This timeline traces my evolution as a teacher, builder, and collaborator—through roles, milestones, and the slow, necessary work of learning what matters.

### 2011–2012 | Residency & Foundation
- **Urban Teacher Residency, Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics**
- Co-taught Algebra II/Trig with a focus on conceptual coherence
- Completed structured inquiry project on assessment-driven instruction

### 2012–2014 | Launching AFSE & Early CS Integration
- Founding CS/math teacher at the Academy for Software Engineering
- Piloted functional programming in Algebra I (with Bootstrap)
- Co-designed early computing curriculum with focus on modeling and structure diagrams
- Led a study measuring functional programming’s impact on problem-solving persistence

### 2015–2017 | Scaling Access & Systems Thinking
- Helped bring AP CS Principles to full 10th-grade cohorts (untracked)
- Developed digital grading tools to support mastery-based workflows
- Mentored students through their first data projects and class-wide surveys
- Joined College Board pilot curriculum teams (BJC, Bootstrap, etc.)

### 2018–2020 | Deepening Practice & Supporting Others
- Coached new CS teachers across NYC via Bootstrap & CSNYC
- Led data science research projects and public student presentations
- Ran internal school tools for student tracking, messaging, and grade export
- Transitioned toward interdisciplinary project design & student agency

### 2021–Present | Reflection, Mentorship & Re-entry
- Stepped back from the classroom to focus on family and consulting
- Continued national coaching through Bootstrap, CS Alliance, and Rutgers
- Developed new curriculum materials for teachers in CS-integrated math
- Working toward rejoining the classroom with sharpened vision and tools

## Sample Case Studies (Coming Soon)
- **“Project-Based AP CSP in an Unscreened School”** – How structure, data, and design recipe helped full cohorts find success
- **“Making Mastery Work”** – Converting raw teacher spreadsheets into a sustainable schoolwide grade reporting system
- **“From Data to Action”** – Student-led engagement survey that shaped staff conversations about motivation

> _Teaching isn’t linear, and neither is growth. But patterns emerge—and the things I kept returning to are the things that matter most: structure, access, collaboration, and care._
