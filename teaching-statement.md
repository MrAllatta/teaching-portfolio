## I run classrooms where students do real thinking—and real work.

In my computer science and math classrooms, students build tools, solve meaningful problems, and learn how to think critically about systems. My teaching blends **structured inquiry with firm expectations**--students are supported, challenged, and held accountable in equal measure.

I design lessons around real questions, not rote procedures. Whether they’re debugging a loop or analyzing survey data, students learn to take intellectual risks, work collaboratively, and reflect on their own thinking. These are not quiet, compliant rooms—they're active, purposeful environments where **students make their thinking visible** and practice turning curiosity into competence.

## I believe in rigor **and** access.

My classrooms are deliberately inclusive: I’ve taught full-grade cohorts AP Computer Science Principles in unscreened schools. I've built feeder programs that prepare diverse students for AP CS A and beyond--not just to pass a test, but to pursue meaningful, high-level work in computing. 

Rigor doesn’t mean gatekeeping--it means building systems where **all students can grow**, and where academic challenge comes with the support to meet it.

## I teach students to figure things out.

That’s what matters. Not just whether they can recite a definition--but whether they can design, revise, persist, and debug their way to insight. Whether they can work with unfamiliar problems and turn ideas into working systems.

That’s what I teach. And that’s what they learn.
