## Jumpro.pe Dashboards & Reporting Glue

From 2018 onward, I built a suite of spreadsheet-based tools to augment the limitations of the school's official mastery grading platform, Jumpro.pe. These tools served as the connective tissue between raw grading data, teacher workflows, school leadership visibility, and student/family communication.

### Core Functions

- **Live Data Processing**: Exported mastery assessment data from Jumpro.pe, enriched with student, teacher, and course metadata.
- **Skill Roll-Ups**: Aggregated student performance across aligned skills, feeding into the grade converter system and reporting dashboards.
- **Attendance & Comment Integration**: Pulled in separate attendance systems and teacher-provided feedback, building a richer view of student standing.
- **Trend Visualization**: Created schoolwide and cohort-level dashboards showing growth over time, flagging risk areas, and surfacing patterns that had never before been visible to leadership.

### Mail Merge & Targeted Communication

- **Family Reports**: Merged data into individualized progress reports, formatted for clarity, translated using home language data from ATS, and sent to families.
- **Team Planning Tools**: Enabled grade teams to slice data by advisory, course, or flagged skill areas—creating specific student subsets for targeted interventions.

### Pandemic Recovery

- During post-COVID credit recovery, these systems became essential. The entire school’s summer programming ran through dashboards I built—tracking incomplete coursework, aligning skill targets, and reporting outcomes back to leadership, staff, and families.
