## Student-Led Survey & Data Science Research Project

**Overview:**
In this interdisciplinary project, students designed, deployed, and analyzed their own engagement survey to explore questions about school climate, identity, and student experience. The goal was to build fluency in **data collection, statistical analysis**, and **computational thinking** using real, personally relevant datasets.

**Skills Developed:**
- Survey design (bias, scale, and sampling considerations)
- Data cleaning and organization
- Visualization using spreadsheets and Pyret
- Interpretation and storytelling with data

**Project Flow:**
1. **Question Framing:** Students selected focus areas (e.g. engagement, belonging, academic support)
2. **Survey Design:** Created and critiqued questions collaboratively
3. **Data Collection:** Anonymous survey via Google Forms or paper
4. **Cleaning & Structuring:** Converted to usable format in Sheets
5. **Analysis & Visualization:** Used formulas and Pyret to analyze trends
6. **Presentation:** Created one-page infographics and short reflection essays

**Tools Used:**
- Google Forms & Sheets
- Pyret or Python (optional extension)
- Bootstrap’s Data Science modules (as support material)

**Outcomes:**
- Students gained agency in shaping inquiry and interpreting findings
- Several groups presented to peers and staff during advisory or parent night
- Some findings led to real discussion about school policy and engagement strategies

**Note:** A full student sample and rubric will be available here soon. Reach out if you’d like to preview drafts or see project guides.
