üìç Relocating to NYC by July 2025  

## **Summary**  
Experienced computer science and mathematics educator with over a decade of success in New York City public schools. Specializes in computational modeling, functional programming, and high-rigor curriculum design. Founding teacher at the Academy for Software Engineering (AFSE), and proven leader in scaling CS and data science instruction for diverse learners. Nationally recognized trainer and presenter with a deep commitment to equitable computing access, even in under-resourced classrooms. Known for building instructional systems that foster reflection, coherence, and measurable student growth.

## **Certification & Licensure**  
- **New York State Professional Certificate** ‚Äì 7‚Äì12 Mathematics  
- **New York State Initial Certificate (in progress)** ‚Äì K‚Äì12 Computer Science *(Anticipated June 2027)*  

## **Teaching & Instructional Leadership**
### **Academy for Software Engineering (AFSE)**  
**Mathematics & Computer Science Teacher, Department Lead**  
*NYC Department of Education | 2012‚Äì2021*  
- Designed and taught Algebra, Computational Math, and CS Principles using data science and functional programming (Pyret, Bootstrap).  
- Founded AP CS Principles program; adapted curriculum to emphasize abstraction, algorithmic modeling, and real-world datasets.  
- Led cross-department vertical alignment to integrate computational thinking into Algebra, Precalculus, and Statistics.  
- Built systems for mastery-based grading and remote progress monitoring, contributing to consistent 90%+ graduation rates.  
- Mentored students for showcases at Bloomberg, ISTE, and CS4All events; supported scholarship and internship pathways.  

### **Programming in Java Instructor & AP CS A Collaborator**  
- Co-taught feeder programming courses using object-oriented Java and examples-driven pedagogy.  
- Partnered with AP CS A instructors to vertically align course content and improve student preparation.  
- Applied design-by-contract and paired instructional strategies with software engineering partners.  

### **Urban Teacher Resident**  
**Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics | 2011‚Äì2012**  
- Taught Algebra II/Trigonometry; led Regents prep and assessment-driven instruction.  
- Conducted action research on formative assessment and student performance in upper-level math.

## Instructional Systems Design & Engineering
Selected projects demonstrating the use of spreadsheet-based automation, data integration, and instructional infrastructure.

### Parent-Student-Teacher Communication System via ATS ‚Üí Remind Integration
Developed a secure, scalable system to import and process student and guardian contact data from the NYC DOE‚Äôs Automate The Schools (ATS) system into Remind, a school communication platform.

- Used advanced spreadsheet logic and data validation to:
- Match students with multiple guardians while respecting language preferences and custody considerations.
- Automatically assign students to teachers and advisory groups based on shared instructional context.
- Enable targeted, role-sensitive messaging (e.g., academic warnings, celebration notes, multilingual updates).

Result: Dramatically improved outreach rates in hard-to-reach populations and supported school-wide systems of care and accountability during both in-person and remote instruction.

### Jumprope ‚Üí Reporting & Progress Monitoring System
Designed and maintained a suite of spreadsheet-based tools using export data from the Jumprope standards-based grading platform to streamline:

- Real-time dashboards for mastery tracking across math, CS, and advisory courses.
- Graduation eligibility planning using dynamic credit tallies, state exam requirements, and IEP/ENL adjustments.
- Collaborative team planning tools, linking grade-level and department leads with centralized insights into student progress and intervention outcomes.
- Architected parent/child spreadsheet systems with push/pull syncing logic, enabling flexible data ownership while maintaining system integrity.

Result: Empowered instructional teams to monitor, respond to, and improve student outcomes across hundreds of learners ‚Äî even in remote learning contexts.
