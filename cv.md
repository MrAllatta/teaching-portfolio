## **Teaching & Instructional Leadership**
### **Academy for Software Engineering (AFSE)**  
**Mathematics & Computer Science Teacher, Department Lead**  
*NYC Department of Education | 2012‚Äì2021*  
- Designed and taught Algebra, Computational Math, and CS Principles using data science and functional programming (Pyret, Bootstrap).  
- Founded AP CS Principles program; adapted curriculum to emphasize abstraction, algorithmic modeling, and real-world datasets.  
- Led cross-department vertical alignment to integrate computational thinking into Algebra, Precalculus, and Statistics.  
- Built systems for mastery-based grading and remote progress monitoring, contributing to consistent 90%+ graduation rates.  
- Mentored students for showcases at Bloomberg, ISTE, and CS4All events; supported scholarship and internship pathways.  

### **Programming in Java Instructor & AP CS A Collaborator**  
- Co-taught feeder programming courses using object-oriented Java and examples-driven pedagogy.  
- Partnered with AP CS A instructors to vertically align course content and improve student preparation.  
- Applied design-by-contract and paired instructional strategies with software engineering partners.  

### **Urban Teacher Resident**  
**Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics | 2011‚Äì2012**  
- Taught Algebra II/Trigonometry; led Regents prep and assessment-driven instruction.  
- Conducted action research on formative assessment and student performance in upper-level math.

## Instructional Systems Design & Engineering
Selected projects demonstrating the use of spreadsheet-based automation, data integration, and instructional infrastructure.

### Parent-Student-Teacher Communication System via ATS ‚Üí Remind Integration
Developed a secure, scalable system to import and process student and guardian contact data from the NYC DOE‚Äôs Automate The Schools (ATS) system into Remind, a school communication platform.

- Used advanced spreadsheet logic and data validation to:
- Match students with multiple guardians while respecting language preferences and custody considerations.
- Automatically assign students to teachers and advisory groups based on shared instructional context.
- Enable targeted, role-sensitive messaging (e.g., academic warnings, celebration notes, multilingual updates).

Result: Dramatically improved outreach rates in hard-to-reach populations and supported school-wide systems of care and accountability during both in-person and remote instruction.

### Jumprope ‚Üí Reporting & Progress Monitoring System
Designed and maintained a suite of spreadsheet-based tools using export data from the Jumprope standards-based grading platform to streamline:

- Real-time dashboards for mastery tracking across math, CS, and advisory courses.
- Graduation eligibility planning using dynamic credit tallies, state exam requirements, and IEP/ENL adjustments.
- Collaborative team planning tools, linking grade-level and department leads with centralized insights into student progress and intervention outcomes.
- Architected parent/child spreadsheet systems with push/pull syncing logic, enabling flexible data ownership while maintaining system integrity.

Result: Empowered instructional teams to monitor, respond to, and improve student outcomes across hundreds of learners ‚Äî even in remote learning contexts.
