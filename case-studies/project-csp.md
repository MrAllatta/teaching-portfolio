## Case Study: Project-Based AP CSP in an Unscreened School

**Overview:**  
How do you bring a college-level CS course to a school where many students are still catching up in Algebra I? This case study describes a multi-year effort to adapt AP CS Principles into an accessible, meaningful, and standards-aligned experience for *all* students in a diverse, unscreened NYC public school.

**Challenge:**  
Deliver rigorous computing content to ~120 10th graders per year, most with no prior coding experience, limited math confidence, and wide variation in literacy skills.

### What We Did
- Adopted a **functional programming pedagogy** (Racket, then Pyret) to reinforce algebraic reasoning and structured thinking
- Centered the course around **data science and real-world modeling**, using Bootstrap’s CSP pathway as the spine
- Embedded **design recipe scaffolds** to support all students in writing, debugging, and analyzing functions
- Built in **weekly reflective blogging** and **student voice surveys** to track engagement and agency
- Supported students in completing **both Explore & Create tasks**, with authentic data projects often replacing contrived app demos

### What Worked
- **Completion rates** for the full AP CSP submission steadily improved each year, despite the exam’s misalignment with our tools
- **Classroom engagement** was higher with project-based themes and student-selected datasets
- **Math/CS integration** reinforced key function modeling skills also needed for Algebra I success
- **Student work quality** was notably stronger on open-ended tasks where structure met creativity

### What We Learned
- Students responded best to **authenticity + structure**—real data, real questions, with real scaffolds
- The AP exam’s framing limited the expressive scope for some projects, but the learning still held
- Some students self-selected into **Java/AP CS A the following year**, seeing a path forward in computing

> _“I used to think coding was just for games or websites. But when we worked with survey data, I realized I could ask my own questions. That made me want to keep going.”_ — Student reflection

This case study demonstrates that high-level computing instruction can be accessible and rigorous—*when it’s reimagined with pedagogy, not just content, in mind.*
