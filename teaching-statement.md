I believe students learn most deeply when they’re active participants in their own education. My teaching philosophy is grounded in constructivism—the idea that knowledge is built through inquiry, experimentation, and reflection. My role is to create structured opportunities for students to wrestle with challenging ideas, and to guide—not dominate—their path toward understanding.

### What That Looks Like:
- **Inquiry First**: Lessons are built around authentic questions and patterns, not procedures.
- **Balanced Autonomy**: Students explore with guidance that sharpens rather than limits their thinking.
- **Concept Over Procedure**: Deep structure always precedes shortcuts.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Thinking**: Math and CS support each other—intellectually and practically.

When I design instruction with these values, students grow into resilient, confident, and flexible thinkers—the kind of learners who can adapt to unfamiliar problems and collaborate effectively.

## Integrating Mathematics & Computer Science

I treat **mathematics and computer science** as overlapping ways to model, reason, and communicate. Whether through functions or code, students develop algorithmic thinking and abstract reasoning that are portable across disciplines.

### My Approach:
- **Programming as Mathematical Modeling**: Students explore functions, logic, and representation through code.
- **Data-Driven Projects**: Real-world datasets ground statistical reasoning and promote engagement.
- **Scaffolded Design**: From contract-by-design to iterative debugging, students build complexity gradually.
- **Visible Thinking**: Students explain, diagram, and revise their ideas publicly and collaboratively.

By aligning programming and math instruction, I help students understand how systems work—and how they can shape them.

## Student Growth & Impact

Test scores matter, but they’re not my compass. I measure impact by how students grow as **problem solvers and decision-makers**.

### Examples of Impact:
- **Expanding Access**: Opened AP CS Principles to entire 10th grade cohorts in an unscreened school.
- **Feeder to AP CS A**: Built a Java course that prepared students for success in upper-level CS.
- **Data Science Projects**: Students created and analyzed surveys to study their own school experience.
- **Mathematical Habits of Mind**: Used programming to reinforce core math practices and precision.

Success means students leave with tools—not just to pass a test, but to pursue problems that matter to them.

## Commitment to Equity

I believe that rigor and access are not opposites. My classroom design reflects a belief that every student deserves challenge *and* support.

### Equity in Practice:
- **Entry Points for All**: Tasks are low floor, high ceiling, and intentionally scaffolded.
- **Culturally Relevant Examples**: Projects use data and contexts that resonate with students’ lives.
- **Tool Fluency as Equity**: I teach computing tools with purpose, not as barriers or afterthoughts.
- **Community Voice**: I make space for student interest, feedback, and reflection to shape the curriculum.

The goal isn’t to bring students to my version of success—it’s to help them define and pursue their own.

## Closing

I don’t just want students to *know* things. I want them to know how to *figure things out*. To debug their logic, their assumptions, and their code. To ask good questions, take meaningful risks, and build systems that work.

That’s what I build classrooms to do.
