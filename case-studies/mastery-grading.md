## Case Study: Making Mastery Work

**Overview:**  
In a school where teachers embraced mastery-based grading in theory but struggled to make it operational, I designed tools and workflows that turned aspiration into actionable practice—without burning teachers out.

**Challenge:**  
How do you support mastery-based learning when the gradebook, reporting system, and culture all expect traditional numeric grades?

### What We Did
- Built a **Grade Converter Tool** that let teachers enter mastery-level descriptors (e.g. 4, 3, 2, 1) and auto-convert them into uploadable numeric formats for NYC’s STARS system
- Designed spreadsheets that could **auto-populate student data** by course and ID, streamlining workflow for over a dozen teachers
- Provided coaching on **rubric design**, performance bands, and feedback alignment
- Supported **data merges with ATS** to ensure students were tracked by real-time rosters

### What Worked
- Teachers saved **dozens of hours per term**, reducing late submissions and increasing grading clarity
- The tool helped shift grading conversations toward **consistency and transparency**, not just logistics
- New teachers were able to onboard faster and adopt a **skills-based mindset** early in their practice

### What We Learned
- Mastery systems fail when **admin tools aren’t aligned**—but lightweight tools can patch the gap
- Teachers need **confidence and clarity**, not just a grading scheme
- Automation works best when it supports a pedagogical *ethos*, not just convenience

This case study shows how internal systems design—done with empathy and iteration—can turn instructional theory into sustainable daily practice.
