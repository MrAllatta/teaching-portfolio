## Flag Project: Symbolic Expression Through Geometry & Code

**Overview:**
This interdisciplinary project challenged students to design a personal or cultural flag using geometric principles and code. It served as a capstone for early programming and coordinate geometry skills, encouraging both **creative expression** and **mathematical reasoning**.

**Learning Goals:**
- Reinforce concepts in 2D geometry (translations, symmetry, area)
- Practice modular programming with parameters and functions
- Explore symbolism, identity, and communication through design
- Connect visual art, math, and code into a single expressive product

**Process:**
1. **Sketching & Planning:** Students explored symbolism, sketched flags, and mapped ideas to shapes
2. **Coding Phase:** Using a language like Pyret or Java, students coded flags using geometric primitives and functions
3. **Presentation:** Each student explained their design choices, the math involved, and reflected on the process

**Skills Emphasized:**
- Functional abstraction and reusable code blocks
- Coordinate geometry and transformations
- Mathematical communication and critique

**Artifacts:**
- Flag images (generated from code)
- Annotated code samples
- Written reflections on symbolism and design

**Outcomes:**
- Project showcased at student-led exhibition nights
- Helped anchor abstract math in personal, visual ways
- Enabled students to connect identity, culture, and computation

**Note:** Student samples and project rubric will be added shortly. Please reach out via the [Contact](/contact/) page if you'd like to preview materials.
