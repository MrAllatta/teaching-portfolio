## Case Studies in Practice

These case studies document specific instructional challenges and how I approached them—with a focus on iterative design, inclusive pedagogy, and meaningful student work.

Each one highlights:
- The **context and constraints**
- The **instructional design choices**
- What **worked**, what didn’t, and what we learned

These are not “best practices”—they’re real examples of teaching in the wild.

> _Good teaching is mostly about knowing your context, trying something thoughtful, and being willing to revise._
