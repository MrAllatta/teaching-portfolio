## Professional Development

### Ongoing Learning and Certifications

I have actively engaged in professional development to enhance my teaching practice and stay current with evolving pedagogical and technological trends. My learning has included:

- **Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC):** Training in the curriculum and pedagogy of this AP CS Principles course, which emphasizes functional programming and computing ethics.
- **AP CS Principles:** Certification and continuous development in teaching the College Board's AP CSP curriculum, integrating computational thinking and problem-solving skills.
- **EarSketch:** Professional development in using music and coding to teach computational concepts through Python and JavaScript.
- **Math for America (MfA) Membership:** Active participation in MfA’s professional learning communities, engaging in mathematics and computer science education workshops and discussions.
- **Bootstrap: Algebra & Data Science:** Extensive training in Bootstrap’s integrated computer science and mathematics curriculum, leveraging programming to reinforce algebraic reasoning and data analysis.

### Leadership in Professional Development

In addition to my own learning, I have played a significant role in leading and shaping professional development for educators. My contributions include:

- **Math for America (MfA):** Designed and facilitated workshops for math and computer science educators on curriculum integration, pedagogical strategies, and best practices.
- **Rutgers University:** Led training sessions for pre-service and in-service teachers on implementing computing curricula and engaging students in computational thinking.
- **CSNYC:** Provided coaching and mentorship to teachers implementing CS programs in NYC public schools, offering support in curriculum development and instructional strategies.
- **College Board:** Participated in AP CSP teacher panels, contributed to curriculum discussions, and provided training on effective teaching methodologies for AP Computer Science Principles.

Through these experiences, I have not only deepened my own expertise but have also supported the growth of other educators, helping to expand access to high-quality computer science education.
