## Curriculum Overview

This section provides a high-level view of the CS and math-integrated curriculum I’ve developed and taught over the past decade. My focus is on helping students build **foundational concepts**, apply **computational thinking**, and explore **real-world applications** across disciplines.

### Guiding Principles
- **Mathematics as the Language of Computing**: Emphasizing functions, abstraction, and modeling
- **Real-World Relevance**: Embedding data science and civic inquiry into core instruction
- **Design First, Syntax Second**: Using design recipes and structured problem solving before language-specific details
- **Low-Floor, High-Ceiling Tasks**: Accessible entry points with opportunities for deep extension

### Curriculum Structure
The curriculum is organized in **units** that blend mathematical reasoning, programming, and data analysis:

1. **Functions & Modeling with Code** – Algebra, composition, contracts (Pyret)
2. **Data Science Foundations** – Cleaning, visualizing, and interpreting datasets (Google Sheets, Pyret)
3. **Intro to Object-Oriented Design** – Concepts using Java/Karel/Greenfoot
4. **Systems & Abstractions** – From gates to software (Nand2Tetris)
5. **Computing in Society** – Exploring ethics, privacy, and real-world innovations

Each unit is built around projects, formative assessments, and scaffolded assignments aligned to math and CS standards.
