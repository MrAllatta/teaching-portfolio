## Mastery Rubrics for CS & Math

This case study highlights a long-term initiative to develop a unified set of mastery-based grading rubrics across the computer science and math departments at an unscreened, CS-focused high school. The goal was to align instructional practice with a shared set of high-leverage cognitive skills that reflected both computational thinking and Common Core mathematical practice.

### Background & Vision
As department leader, I facilitated a multi-year collaborative process with colleagues to define, refine, and implement vertically aligned skills across all course levels. This work was heavily influenced by design-recipe pedagogy from Bootstrap and the structure-behavior-data lens from AP CS Principles.

We aimed to shift the grading conversation away from compliance and content coverage and toward demonstration of problem-solving and design fluency. The shared rubrics provided clarity to students, coherence across classes, and a basis for data-informed instructional decisions.

### Implementation
Rubrics were written for each course—Intro CS, Comp Algebra, AP CSP, AP CSA, Capstone, Tech, and more—anchored in five core skills:
1. **Use Tools** (e.g., APIs, contracts, and modeling software)
2. **Read Programs** (predict and explain behavior)
3. **Build Tools** (design headers, classes, methods)
4. **Break Down Problems** (decompose and identify subproblems)
5. **Solve Large Problems** (synthesize to solve complex challenges)

Each rubric articulated four developmental levels: Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner, and Professional. These were used for both formative feedback and summative reporting.

### Impact
- **Professional Culture:** Teachers collaborated across disciplines to calibrate expectations and adapt tasks to align with shared skills.
- **Student Understanding:** Students gained a clearer sense of what mastery looked like and how to progress toward it. Reflection and revision became routine.
- **Platform Integration:** The rubrics were implemented in Jumpro.pe, a mastery-based grading platform. This allowed for consistent tracking of skills across classes and better communication with families.
- **Lasting Infrastructure:** The rubric framework remains in place and continues to guide curriculum design, assessment creation, and departmental planning.
