# Course Recovery and Communication Dashboards

When the pandemic shattered conventional grading, attendance, and promotion structures, I built a suite of spreadsheet-driven dashboards and tools that kept our school community afloat.

Working with raw exports from Jumpro.pe (mastery-based gradebook), attendance systems, and student/course/family rosters, I designed flexible systems that:

- **Merged Student, Family, and Course Data:** Created a unified view of each student's academic standing, attendance, and required interventions.
- **Automated Messaging:** Generated targeted, mail-merged communication to families in their home languages using language fields from ATS.
- **Enabled Real-Time Teacher Planning:** Built dashboards that allowed teachers to filter students into subsets based on skills, course needs, or intervention categories.
- **Produced Trend Data for Leadership:** Gave administrators actionable views into student progress, skill mastery, and recovery needs—often for the first time.

These tools made it possible to run a chaotic "no one can fail" summer recovery program based almost entirely on complex eligibility and course progress conditions—conditions that were too nuanced for official systems to track.

Without these systems, much of the team's planning and family engagement would have collapsed under the administrative load.

> _You can't fix what you can't see. These dashboards turned bureaucratic fog into actionable insight—and kept real students from slipping through cracks that no official system was designed to catch._
