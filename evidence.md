### Scope of Instructional Reach
- **AP CS Principles for All:** Taught entire 10th-grade cohorts (~120 students/year, 2017–2021) in a fully inclusive AP CSP course using an algebra-focused, functional programming curriculum. Despite exam misalignment, course completion rates and full submission of the performance task increased each year.
- **Intro to Computing at Scale:** Delivered 9th-grade computing instruction to ~120 students/year (2012–2016), many of whom had no prior exposure to CS. Course design emphasized visual modeling, recursion, and algebraic reasoning.
- **Data Science Integration:** In later years, shifted to project-based data science instruction, culminating in student-designed research surveys and analysis. Projects featured iterative inquiry, statistical modeling, and public presentation.
- **Cumulative Reach:** Over 1,000 students exposed to computing-infused math curriculum and interdisciplinary problem-solving.

### Sample Student Outcomes
- **Conceptual Growth:** Students routinely transferred skills from CS to algebra and vice versa—building functions, analyzing structure, and debugging both math and code with increasing fluency.
- **Post-Course Trajectories:** Alumni have enrolled in CS courses at Hunter, NYU, and CUNY; one student later co-taught at the Summer Hack League, citing his AP CSP project as a turning point.

### Artifacts & Testimonials
> *“Breaking a bigger problem into smaller, easier-to-solve problems, rather than tackling the problem directly.”* — 10th Grade AP CSP Student

> *“Computer science increased my understanding and usage of programming enough for me to learn other languages on my own.”* — 11th Grade Student

> *“The data project helped me realize I could use math to ask my own questions—not just answer someone else’s.”* — Student Reflection

### Highlighted Student Work
- **[Soda Consumption & Health Survey – Data Science Project (Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p63vfY1CNWrdBwIg2vXW_Nfxl-xG1rTlpYiboGbla-g/edit?usp=drivesdk)**
  A standout capstone by a student who used survey methodology, spreadsheet functions, and graphing to explore correlations in soda intake and health perceptions. Project included full methodology, spreadsheet screenshots, and a student-narrated walkthrough.

### Reflections on Practice
I believe evidence of impact comes not only from test scores but from how often students surprise you with original insight, persistence, or ownership. These projects and voices remind me why I teach: not to check boxes, but to help students build tools they can use beyond the classroom.
