## Student-Led Survey & Data Science Project

**Overview:**
In this interdisciplinary project, students designed, deployed, and analyzed their own engagement survey to explore questions about school climate, motivation, and learning experiences. The goal was to build fluency in **data collection, statistical analysis**, and **computational thinking** using real, personally relevant datasets.

**Skills Developed:**
- Survey design (bias, scale, sampling)
- Data cleaning and spreadsheet modeling
- Visualization in Google Sheets and Pyret
- Interpretation and storytelling with data

**Project Flow:**
1. **Question Framing:** Students collaboratively selected focus areas and formulated questions
2. **Survey Deployment:** Anonymous survey was distributed across grades
3. **Data Cleaning:** Outliers and missing data handled via custom rules and group review
4. **Analysis & Visualization:** Key themes explored with formulas and visual models
5. **Synthesis:** Students created 1-page reports and gave presentations to peers and teachers

**Outcomes:**
- Helped students articulate their educational experiences and frustrations
- Gave visibility to student concerns about school structure, instruction, and motivation
- Laid groundwork for school leadership conversations on student engagement

## Student Voices from the Engagement Survey

> *"The disorganization. It needs to be more organized. Also the lack of electives... make the topics more engaging."*

> *"WAY better application process... actually follow the CTE path you set up for us."*

> *"Some of the questions didn't make sense. If you think about it, the other schools in the building affect AFSE students a lot more than people realize."*

> *"We’re forced to take classes we don’t care for. This school strives on students being motivated and independent. So why do we get no choice?"*

> *"Give us prizes. Good ones. Not baby stuff."*

> *"I would prefer if the people who didn’t care about computer science couldn’t enter the school."*

> *"Have Fresh Water."*

> *"Change the silly democratic rules of grades and change it to a communistic one."*

> *"Sometimes teachers expect us to know advanced stuff without practice. We immediately jump to processing with no explanation."*

> *"This was a bad survey." / "IT WAS NIIIICE YAYAYAYA YAY"*

These quotes show what happens when students are trusted to conduct inquiry into their own environment: honesty, contradiction, humor, critique, and insight.
