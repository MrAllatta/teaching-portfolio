I'm a CS and math educator with 10+ years of experience in NYC public schools, focused on integrating computing and data science into rigorous, equitable instruction. After a hiatus to focus on family, I'm excited to return to the classroom -- especially in a school that values inquiry, collaboration, and interdisciplinary thinking.

At the Academy for Software Engineering (AFSE), I helped launch one of NYC's first CS-themed high schools. Over nine years, I:
- Developed integrated CS-math curriculua using tools like **Bootstrap, Greenfoot, EarSketch, Nand2Tetris**, and **Beauty and Joy of Computing**
- Focused on accessibility and conceptual for diverse learners
- Led interdisciplinary initiatives that strengthened both AP CS enrollment and Algebra Regents outcomes

I thrive in project-based, STEM-focused schools -- especially early college models and interdisciplinary teams. I've:
- Mentored new CS teachers
- Led cross-department planning
- Managaged school-wide systems for internal communication
- Founded an after-school coding club to expand programming access

I also bring technical systems experience. Highlights include:
- Guiding students through a data science initiative to design and analyze a schoolwide engagement survey
- Building integrations with ATS, Remind, and gradebook tools to improve communication and progress tracking

These projects helped schools act on student feedback and manage instruction more effectively.

I'm ready to lead **AP Computer Science, Data Science or an integrated CS-Math course**, and I'm equally at home teaching **Algebra I** or **advanced math with a computing lens**. I believe in transparent grading, regular family communication, and building STEM partnerships that extend learning beyond the school day.
