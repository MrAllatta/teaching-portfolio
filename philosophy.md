## Learning is Slow, Messy, and Worth It

Learning takes time. Deep understanding doesn't emerge from high-speed coverage or performative participation—it grows from thoughtful repetition, productive struggle, and meaningful feedback. Too often, students are rewarded for looking busy, memorizing procedures, or parroting the “right answer.” I work against that pressure.

My classrooms are designed to normalize intellectual risk and reward authentic engagement. I structure **multiple encounters** with core ideas, followed by **challenging applications** that push students beyond familiarity. Feedback is frequent, standards-based, and revision-oriented. This approach creates space for students to grow at different paces—and to see mistakes as part of mastery, not evidence of failure.

## Teaching Computer Science: A Data-First Philosophy

### Computing Is About More Than Code

Computer science is the study of information—how it’s represented, processed, and transformed. My approach to AP CS Principles starts with **data before syntax**: students learn to model and manipulate meaningful, real-world information long before worrying about semicolons.

### CS for All Means Rethinking How We Teach

CS education must be **accessible without being watered down**. I’ve taught AP CSP to entire 10th-grade cohorts in unscreened schools using **Pyret and Racket** to support algebraic thinking and scaffold computation. I emphasize **contract-based design**, visual representations, collaborative projects, and authentic, scaffolded inquiry.

### Computational Thinking is the Goal

Students learn structured design patterns, the “design recipe,” and techniques for tracing, evaluating, and debugging their own logic. These habits build independence, foster persistence, and help students tackle complexity with confidence.

### Assessment That Supports Growth

My assessments prioritize growth and mastery. Students revise their work, engage in peer code reviews, and reflect on their process—not just their output. Projects are graded for clarity of reasoning as well as correctness. The goal is always conceptual ownership, not one-shot compliance.

### CS is Interdisciplinary—and Political

From **data privacy and algorithmic bias** to **coding as creative expression**, my curriculum centers computing’s social context. Students use computing to analyze issues they care about, connect to other academic subjects, and build artifacts that matter.

### Preparing for What Comes Next

I teach CS Principles not just to pass the exam—but to prepare students for **AP CS A and beyond**. Many of my students come in without prior experience. My job is to make sure they leave with the habits, mindset, and technical fluency to succeed—whether in future computing courses or the broader digital world.

## Final Thought

My job isn’t just to teach students how to code—it’s to help them think clearly, ask better questions, and build the confidence to solve hard problems. I believe in **computational literacy as a core skill**, and I’m committed to making that literacy accessible, equitable, and intellectually powerful for every student I teach.
