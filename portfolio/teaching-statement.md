## Core Teaching Philosophy

I believe that deep learning happens when students are active participants in their own education. My teaching philosophy is rooted in **constructivism**, where students build knowledge through inquiry, experimentation, and reflection. My role as an educator is to **design structured opportunities for students to grapple with challenging ideas**, guiding them through discovery rather than simply delivering information.

### Key Tenets:
- **Inquiry-Driven Learning**: Lessons emphasize exploration, questioning, and reasoning.
- **Guided Discovery**: Balancing student freedom with structured guidance.
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Prioritizing deep comprehension over rote procedures.
- **Interdisciplinary Thinking**: Encouraging students to make connections across domains.

By embedding these principles into my classroom, I cultivate an environment where students **develop autonomy, resilience, and intellectual curiosity**—skills that extend far beyond the subject matter.

## Mathematics & Computer Science Integration

I approach both **mathematics and computer science** as disciplines of structured problem-solving. My curriculum encourages students to **think algorithmically, reason abstractly, and communicate ideas clearly**.

### Key Strategies:
- **Problem-Solving as a Core Skill**: Students tackle real-world problems that require logical reasoning and computational thinking.
- **Mathematics as a Language for CS**: I emphasize connections between algebra, functions, and programming structures.
- **Project-Based Learning**: Students engage in hands-on coding projects and data analysis to apply their knowledge in meaningful ways.
- **Debugging & Iteration**: Encouraging students to view mistakes as an essential part of the learning process.

By integrating computing tools into math instruction and vice versa, I help students see how abstract principles apply to practical challenges.

## Impact & Student Growth

I measure success not just by test scores but by how students develop as **independent thinkers and problem solvers**.

### Notable Impacts:
- **Expanding CS Access**: I introduced AP CS Principles to entire 10th-grade cohorts in an unscreened school, opening pathways for students who otherwise wouldn't have taken a computing course.
- **Mathematical Thinking Through CS**: My courses emphasize mathematical reasoning rather than just code syntax, equipping students with transferable skills.
- **Data Science & Personal Inquiry**: Students analyze real-world data, including their own surveys, to apply statistical and computational methods.
- **Student Agency**: I design assignments that allow for multiple approaches and solutions, ensuring students build confidence in their problem-solving abilities.

The impact of my teaching extends beyond content mastery—my students leave my classroom more **resilient, adaptable, and capable of tackling novel challenges**.

## Equity & Accessibility

Education should be **accessible, inclusive, and empowering** for all students, regardless of background.

### My Commitment:
- **Inclusive Course Design**: I structure my curriculum so that students with different skill levels can engage meaningfully.
- **Culturally Relevant Examples**: I use projects and datasets that connect to students' lived experiences.
- **Scaffolded Challenges**: Assignments are designed with entry points for all learners while offering depth for those ready for more complexity.
- **Intentional Use of Technology**: Computing tools should **enhance** learning rather than create barriers, and I ensure students are supported in developing technological fluency.

By emphasizing **student-centered learning, equitable access, and adaptable teaching strategies**, I create a classroom where all students can **see themselves as capable mathematicians, scientists, and problem solvers**.

### Closing Thoughts

My goal as an educator is to **develop thinkers, not just test-takers**. I design my courses to ensure students are not just absorbing information but **actively engaging in the process of learning**, equipping them with the skills they need for success in an evolving world.
