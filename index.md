## Welcome!

I'm an experienced teacher-leader who has spent the past decade designing, building, and refining hands-on, equitable computer science and math programs in NYC public schools.  
Through teaching, coaching, curriculum design, and tools development, I have helped entire departments — and whole schools — grow stronger, more coherent, and more supportive for students and staff alike.

## Areas of Focus

### Teaching & Learning
**Authentic, Accessible Projects**  
Rigorous and creative CS/math curricula — including [capstone projects]({{ '/student-work' | relative_url }}), integrated algebra supports, and [real-world data science experiences]({{ '/student-work/data-science/' | relative_url }}) — for students of all backgrounds.

### Systems & Tools
**Infrastructure that Amplifies Good Work**  
Custom-built grading platforms, engagement dashboards, communication systems, and other "invisible glue" that made mastery-based, student-centered practices actually sustainable.

### Team Development
**Collaborative Growth**  
Led multi-year department efforts to align mastery standards, co-design rubrics, and build a culture of project-based learning — while mentoring new teachers and supporting cross-team planning.

## Featured Projects
- **Mastery Rubrics Aligned Across CS + Math**  
  Facilitated design and implementation of shared mastery grading standards.
- **Data Science Research Project**  
  Full-cohort data investigations with real-world datasets and public presentations.
- **Schoolwide Dashboard Systems**  
  Built custom spreadsheets that streamlined grading, attendance, interventions, and parent outreach — visible at the admin, team, and student levels.

## About Me
I believe that schools should be places where **students feel powerful**, **teachers feel supported**, and **systems work quietly in the background** — not against the people in them.
