This section showcases the hands-on, minds-on projects that form the backbone of my classroom. Each one is designed to develop conceptual understanding, technical fluency, and creative expression—while meeting students where they are.

### Design Pillars
- **Inquiry First** – Projects begin with a question, not a worksheet.
- **Accessible Complexity** – Scaffolded entry points with room to grow
- **Personal Relevance** – Identity, choice, and real-world context
- **Visible Thinking** – Code, reflections, visuals, and presentations

These projects aren't just activities—they’re structured invitations into computational thinking, mathematical modeling, and personal discovery.
